# Almost Katamari
Prototyping features to match Katamari Damacy

## TODO

- [ ] Ball does not rotate over objects, force applied just translates across while it actually should fudge the physics so that the katamari can always be rolled over. This might involve a physics shaders??
    - [Physics Shader Articles](https://medium.com/sun-dog-studios/rapid-unity-tutorials-1-physics-materials-68758351fd8a)
    - Friction on props
- [ ] Prefab the prop object and see if there's a way to script a set of colliders for it.
- [ ] The transparency shader against the wall.
